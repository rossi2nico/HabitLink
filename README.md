## A community based habit tracker built to improve accountability between friends!

This project was created for me and my friends to hold eachother accountable with our habits under a clean user interface with advanced statistics and features.  
- Create habits and choose to keep them private, share with friends, or make them public for accountability
- Track your progress with real‑time charts and statistics
- Manage friends, friend requests, and shared habit members

How features were implemented:  
* Customer user authentication using JWT tokens in localStorage
* Habit privacy allowing users to share habits privately, with friends, or publicly
* RESTful APIs built with Node.js and Express for clean backend communication
* Data visualization with charts and statistics to track habit progress built with Recharts
* Instant frontend UI updates using custom context and hooks
* Habits are linked to each user through an array of habit objects in the user schema
